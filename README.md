========================

Latest release: [1.0.0-alpha1](https://packagist.org/packages/puli/puli#1.0.0-alpha1)

PHP >= 5.3.9

Puli manages files and directories in a virtual repository. Whenever you need
to access these resources in your project, you can find them by their Puli path:

```php
use Puli\Repository\ResourceRepository;

$repo = new ResourceRepository();
$repo->add('/config', '/path/to/resources/config');

// /path/to/resources/config/routing.yml
echo $repo->get('/config/routing.yml')->getContents();
```

This is useful when you have to hard-code paths, for example in configuration
files:

```yaml
# config.yml
import: /config/routing.yml
```
